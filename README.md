JS Fundamentals Assignment (10%) – GitHub Submission
Instructions for Students

Hey everyone,

This assignment is designed to reinforce key JavaScript concepts we’ve covered so far. You’ll be working with variables, data types, type casting, operators, user input, conditionals, and loops—all essential for writing functional JavaScript programs.

Follow the instructions carefully, and make sure to submit your GitHub repository link once you're done.
What You Need to Do
1️⃣ Set Up Your Project (GitHub Submission Required!)

    Create a new GitHub repository named JS_Fundamentals_Assignment_YourName.
    Push your project files to the repository.
    Submit the GitHub repository link on the LMS before the deadline.

📁 Your project should have these two files:

    index.html (Your HTML page to display results)
    script.js (Your JavaScript code file)

2️⃣ Complete the Following JavaScript Tasks
🔹 Part 1: Variables, Data Types & Type Casting (2 Marks)

    Declare three variables:
        studentName (string)
        studentAge (number)
        isEnrolled (boolean)
    Display these values on the webpage using document.write().
    Convert studentAge into a string and display the data type before and after conversion.

🔹 Part 2: Operators & User Interaction (3 Marks)

    Ask the user to enter two numbers using prompt().
    Convert the inputs to numbers and perform:
        Addition (+)
        Subtraction (-)
        Multiplication (*)
        Division (/)
        Modulus (%)
    Use document.write() to show the results on the webpage.

🔹 Part 3: Conditional Execution (2 Marks)

    Ask the user to enter their age.
    Use an if-else statement to check:
        If the user is 18 or older, display "You are eligible to vote!".
        Otherwise, display "You are not eligible to vote yet."
    Use comparison and logical operators correctly.

🔹 Part 4: Loops (3 Marks)

    For Loop: Print numbers from 1 to 10 on the webpage.
    While Loop:
        Prompt the user to enter a number greater than 10.
        Keep asking until they enter a valid number.

3️⃣ Grading Rubric (Total: 10 Marks)
